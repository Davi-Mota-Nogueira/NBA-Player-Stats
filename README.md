# NBA Players Status
Project to improve the abilities of Data Analysis

There are some questions that this project have to answer:

- Which players lead their seasons in scoring, rebounding, and playmaking - and how efficient are they?
- How do players from different eras (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s) compare in size, style, and performance-
- Which teams, positions, or player types consistently produce top performers?
- Based on the data, who deserves the MVP crown - and how does your pick compare to the official NBA MVP?

The site also give some instruction to what you can do:

1. Player Performance Analysis
   - Rank players in each season by points, rebounds, assists per game.
   - Compare efficiency stats (TS% vs usage%) - do volume scorers sacrifice efficiency?
   - Identify most improved players across seasons (biggest jump in points/rebounds/assists).

2. Era & Team Comparisons
    - Compare average player size (height/weight) between 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.
    - Identify which teams consistently produce top-performing players.
    - Look at rookies vs veterans - how do their contributions differ?

3. MVP & Dream Team
    - Use a weighted index (e.g., 40% points, 30% rebounds/assists, 30% efficiency) to find an MVP for a given season.
    - Build your dream starting 5 (PG, SG, SF, PF, C) using stats across all seasons.
    - Bonus: Compare your MVP pick with the actual NBA MVP that season.
